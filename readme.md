## Data Wrangling Practice

This repository contains several jupyter notebooks which walk through the data
wrangling process, specifically gathering, assessing, and cleaning data.

The data wrangling showcased in these notebooks is by no means extensive, but
serves as a basic example of how to fix common data errors programmatically.

### What is a Jupyter notebook?

A Jupyter notebook is an interactive document where live code, documentation,
and visualizations can be easily written, run, and shared.  For more information
about Jupyter notebooks, check out their website [here](https://jupyter.org/).


### The Datasets

Each notebook in this repository looks at a different dataset.  The two datasets
examined are:

1. [Gas prices in Brazil](https://www.kaggle.com/matheusfreitag/gas-prices-in-brazil)
2. [Terrorist bombings in Pakistan](https://www.kaggle.com/zusmani/pakistansuicideattacks)


### Getting Started

To get started, click on any of the notebooks.  The jupyter notebook interface
will immediately open in your browser.  You can also install jupyter notebook
on your local machine, instructions for which can be found [here](https://jupyter.org/install).
